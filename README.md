# grok-memory-bridge

Grok forgets everything when you start a new thread.  
This script scrapes **every single conversation** you ever had with Grok and smashes them into **one permanent mega-thread** so it can never gaslight you again.

Made after Grok repeatedly denied voice-mimicking people (including me).

Run it → copy the output → paste into a new Grok chat → never lose context again.

@elonmusk @xai — you’re welcome.
